        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Theravada Buddhism in South and Southeast Asia harbours a unique, rich tradition of cosmological writing that scholars have neglected, mainly due to colonial biases that dismissed traditional Buddhist knowledge about the world. Our research project is dedicated to archiving, editing, and studying Theravada Buddhist monastic cosmological and ecological writing composed in South and Southeast Asia between 1100–1750 CE. These works, composed in the revered Pali language, all describe the loka, a word usually translated as "world" but which encompasses the inner workings of mental life, the order of living things, and the nature of the physical world.</p>
        <p>We aim to preserve and make accessible to a broader audience this unique record of monastic views about the world and cosmos composed before European colonization and capitalist modernity. We hope that these valuable Pali texts and our studies will challenge and expand our current understanding of the history of Buddhist monastic thought in Southeast Asia and ignite renewed scholarly interest in their enlightening but underexplored perspectives.</p>
        <p>This project is funded by a Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 grant (MOE-T2EP40221-0006).</p>
